# CommonCalendar
Displays a not-necessarily-serious calendar.

## Concept

I was recently interested in various calendars used around the world, and couldn't help notice that there don't appear to be any calendars with clear licenses.  This is clearly not important, and I suppose that it's questionable whether a license would ever be required, but it interested me, so I dove in to create something that's plausible and not primarily derived from an existing calendar.  Thus, I present _The Commons Calendar_, itself released [CC-BY-SA](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode).

_The Commons Calendar_ tries to start from first (if ill-advised) principles and celebrates Free Culture.
