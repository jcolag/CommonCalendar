# CommonCalendar
Displays a not-necessarily-serious calendar.

## Concept

I was recently interested in various calendars used around the world, and couldn't help notice that there don't appear to be any calendars with clear licenses.  This is clearly not important, and I suppose that it's questionable whether a license would ever be required, but it interested me, so I dove in to create something that's plausible and not primarily derived from an existing calendar.  Thus, I present _The Commons Calendar_, itself released [CC-BY-SA](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode), by contrast to the code's [GNU AGPL v3](https://opensource.org/licenses/agpl-3.0).

_The Commons Calendar_ tries to start from first (if ill-advised) principles and celebrates Free Culture.

### Other Calendars

The first step was to get a rough idea of the layout, by seeing the possible breakdowns of the year with various small numbers of intercalary days.

 - 365's prime factors are 5 x 73, which turns out to be the [Discordian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discordian_calendar).
 
 - 364's prime factors (+1) are 2 x 2 x 7 x 13, which happens to be the [Positivist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positivist_calendar)/[Georgian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Jones_%28professor%29#Georgian_Calendar_.28Pancronometer.29).

 - 363's prime factors (+2) are 3 x 11 x 11.

 - 362's prime factors (+3) are 2 x 181, not particularly useful.

 - 361's prime factors (+4) are 19 x 19, which is used in the [Baha'i calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bah%C3%A1'%C3%AD_calendar).

 - 360's prime factors (+5) are 2 x 2 x 2 x 3 x 3 x 5, which would be a genericized twelve-month, thirty-day calendar, a simplified [Gregorian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar).

 - 359 (+6) is prime, _definitely_ not useful.

 - 358's prime factors (+7) are 2 x 179, again, not very useful.

Beyond a week of intercalary days seems pointless, so process of elimination leaves _The Commons Calendar_ with a plausible, if quirky, eleven months of thirty-three days each, plus two intercalary days.
